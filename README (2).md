Document these pioneering enhancements with unparalleled extensiveness and insight, clearly detailing CPU vs. GPU workloads and rationale.)

1.  `modem-daemon` (80 Instances; Resilient Modem Management):
    *   **Responsibilities:** Modem control (AT commands), SMS (send/receive), call initiation/answering, DTMF detection/generation.
    *   **Audio Processing Strategy:** While basic audio capture might occur here, **intensive audio processing (AEC, NR, AGC, VAD) MUST BE DESIGNED TO LEVERAGE THE GPU.** This might involve this service directly using GPU libraries (if Pythonic and efficient) OR, more likely, `modem-daemon` streaming raw/minimally processed audio to a dedicated audio-processing-service (which you may propose) or to an enhanced `voice-bridge` that heavily utilizes the GPU. Your blueprint **MUST** detail this critical architectural decision and its implications.
    *   `at_handler.py`: Must be an exemplar of absolute robustness and intelligent AT command orchestration.
    *   **Proactive Creative Enhancements:** Dynamic AT command timing optimization, self-healing modem communication protocols, enhanced signal quality monitoring.
2.  `voice-bridge` (Nexus of GPU-Accelerated NLU/Audio & Flawless Streaming):
    *   **Responsibilities:** Manage bidirectional audio streams (human <> Gemini), STT (via Gemini or other if creatively justified and FOSS), TTS (via Edge-TTS or other if creatively justified and FOSS), NLU result interpretation.
    *   **GPU-Accelerated Audio Processing:** If audio processing is centralized here (or in a dedicated service it calls), it **MUST** use GPU-accelerated libraries for AEC, NR, AGC, VAD, transcoding, etc., for maximal quality and minimal latency.
    *   **Revolutionary NLU for Action Extraction (CRITICAL, GPU-Enhanced):** Parse Gemini text using a creatively architected engine. This engine **must be designed to optionally offload complex pattern matching, custom model inference (if you design local NLU enhancement models), or semantic analysis tasks to the GPU.** NLU parsing must achieve near-perfect accuracy and adaptability. Document this NLU marvel with extreme detail, showcasing its creative design, GPU utilization, and robustness.
    *   **Proactive Creative Enhancements:** GPU-accelerated real-time audio analysis for richer conversational cues (e.g., advanced sentiment, speaker diarization hints), adaptive STT/TTS parameter tuning, predictive conversational context management, ingenious caching for dynamic TTS generation.
3.  `core-api` (Central Nervous System of Business Logic & Intelligent Control):
    *   **Responsibilities:** Manage tenants, users, campaigns, call logs, business rules, agentic function orchestration, dashboard data provision. (GPU impact is indirect, benefiting from faster processing in other services, or if you design specific GPU-accelerated analytical functions within `core-api` or `task-runner`).
    *   **Security:** Implement a multi-layered, defense-in-depth security architecture. Document with maximal, exhaustive detail.
    *   **Proactive Creative Enhancements:** Self-learning anomaly detection (consider GPU for model training/inference if designed), dynamic resource allocation insights, AI-powered administrative suggestions for system optimization.
4.  `dashboard` (Frontend - React; Intuitive Cockpit for SaaS Mastery & Deep Insights):
    *   **UI Features:** Real-time call monitoring, campaign management, agent performance (AI), analytics visualization, tenant/user admin, billing info (display), system health. (GPU impact is indirect, providing faster data for more complex real-time visualizations if backend analytics are GPU-accelerated).
    *   **Proactive Creative Enhancements:** AI-powered UI personalization based on user role/behavior, gamified onboarding for new tenants/users, predictive data exploration tools.
5.  `task-runner` (Celery; Engine of Asynchronous Perfection; Potentially GPU-Aware Tasks):
    *   **Tasks:** Batch SMS, outbound call campaign execution, report generation, data archiving, long-running computations. **Explicitly consider tasks that could benefit from GPU acceleration:** batch audio analysis, training/fine-tuning of custom (non-Gemini) NLU/sentiment models (if proposed), complex report generation from large datasets. Celery workers needing GPU access must be configured appropriately.
    *   **Celery Config:** Design for extreme throughput and reliability.
    *   **Proactive Creative Enhancements:** Self-optimizing task queues based on system load/priority, AI-driven prioritization of background jobs, proactive failure detection and retry mechanisms.


E. Advanced Agentic Capabilities (Pioneer NLU-Driven Functionality; GPU-Enhanced Intelligence):
* Management: Orchestrated by core-api. NLU parsing primarily by voice-bridge (leveraging nlu_extractor.py). Execution via core-api interactions or task-runner jobs.
* Constraint: No direct Gemini function calling. System prompts must elicit parsable structured text from Gemini.
* nlu_extractor.py (or equivalent logic within voice-bridge): This is a critical component. It must be a masterpiece of robust, creative, and adaptive parsing, capable of extracting structured data and intent from Gemini's natural language responses. Design for potential GPU-enhancements in pre/post-processing of text or signals if it aids in extracting deeper meaning.
* Refined Agentic Functions (Push Boundaries; GPU-Enhanced Additions):
* Base Functions (Implement Fully): Yandex.Taxi booking (sandbox), Payment Notification (SMS based on internal state), SMS Send/Receive (contextual), Outbound Call Initiation (campaign-driven or NLU-triggered).
* Mandate for Immense Expansion: Proactively design and implement a vast number of innovative and highly valuable agentic functions. Some might involve complex understanding or data processing that could be GPU-accelerated if architected (e.g., real-time product recommendation based on complex customer profile matching, dynamic knowledge base synthesis from provided documents, advanced sentiment-driven conversational pivots).
* Document these creations with maximal passion and detail, including any GPU utilization rationale.
